Set HOST (IP or current host name - default 127.0.0.1) and PORT (default 11111)
in config.h for PC-Speaker Server to listen on. Installation directory
PREFIX (default /usr/local), ETCDIR, BINDIR, SBINDIR (default PREFIX/...)
are configurable via Makefile.cnf.
Now you can run:

 make                    # equivalent of:
 su                      # make && make install
 make install            # is: make all

If you want to change these settings in future without using make, just do:

 make install-config

and it will create 1 file: ETCDIR/pcspk.conf with actual default settings.

pcspkd & pcspk looks also for local config-file: HOME/.pcspkrc

All settings can be changed using options from command-line.
Just run:

 pcspk --help
 pcspkd --help


For slackware users there is also rc.pcspkd generated by

 make slackware-install

and automatically copied to /etc/rc.d.
Add line to system startup file /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

 /etc/rc.d/rc.pcspkd start

if you want to start PC-Speaker Server at boot time.


! Remember: pcspkd must be run from tty or by root !
