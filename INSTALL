If you have previous version (0.0.1), uninstall it:

 make uninstall-examples PREFIX=/if/other/than/usr/local/

Set HOSTNAME (IP or current host name - default 127.0.0.1), PORT (default
11111) in Makefile for PC-Speaker Server to listen on, PREFIX (default
/usr/local) and proper BEEPDIR if you have already beep installed (from
http://www.johnath.com/beep/). Otherwise you must download beep and install
it, f.e. in BEEPDIR (default PREFIX/sbin) by typing

 make beep-all           #caution: it won't download & install man pages, etc.

Now you can run

 make                    # Info:
 su                      # make && make install <=> make all
 make install            # make beep-all && make all <=> make world
 
There is also rc.pcspkd generated, which you can copy to system startup dir and
add line to system startup file (f.e. in Slackware it is /etc/rc.d/rc.local):

 ./rc.pcspkd start
