If you have an old version (0.0.[12]), uninstall it:

 make uninstall-old-examples PREFIX=/if/other/than/usr/local/

Set HOST (IP or current host name - default 127.0.0.1), PORT (default
11111) in Makefile.cnf for PC-Speaker Server to listen on, PREFIX (default
/usr/local), ETCDIR, BINDIR, SBINDIR (default PREFIX/...). Now you can run

 make                    # equivalent of:
 su                      # make && make install
 make install            # is: make all

If you want to change these settings in future without using make, just do:

 make install-configs

and it will create 2 files: ETCDIR/pcspk.conf and ETCDIR/pcspkd.conf with
actual default settings.

pcspkd & pcspk looks also for local config-files in HOME dir:
HOME/pcspk/pcspk.conf & HOME/pcspk/pcspkd.conf.

All settings can be changed using options from command-line.
Just run:

 pcspk --help
 pcspkd --help

There is also rc.pcspkd, which you can copy to system startup dir and
add line to system startup file (f.e. in Slackware it is /etc/rc.d/rc.local):

 /etc/rc.d/rc.pcspkd start

! Remember: pcspkd must be run from tty or by root !
