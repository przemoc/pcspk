Set ip, port in Makefile for pc-speaker server to listen on.
There are other options you can change freely.

If you have beep from http://www.johnath.com/beep/ then set proper BEEPDIR
and run

 make
 su
 make install
 
Otherwise you must download beep.c before, compile and install in BEEPDIR.
If you don't need man pages for it etc. simplest way to do this is run

 make beep-all

There is also rc.pcspk generated, which you should add to system startup file
(f.e. in Slackware it is /etc/rc.d/rc.local)
